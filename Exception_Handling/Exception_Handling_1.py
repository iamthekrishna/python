# Exception Handling : - is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events
# when a computer runs,Exception handling  deal with these events to avoid the program 
# of the system crashing, and without these process exception would disrupt the 
# operation of a program.

# Exception In Python : Python is many built -in exceptions that are raised when you
# program encounters an error(something in the program goes the wrong)
# when these exception occur, python iterpreted stop the current process and passes 
# it to the calling process until it is handled.if not handled ,the program will crash. 

# An Exception is an event which ocuurs during the execution of program that disrupts normal flow of program.
# Situation that python can'tcope with it.

# Why it is Danngerous :- 1).Lead to sudden termination of program.
# 2).Can block the application, 3).Data loss problem can occur 
# 4). Corrupt data files.

# Python try..except: - try..except block are used in python to handle the error and
#  exceptions.The code in try block run when these is no error. if try block catches
#  the error , then the except block is executed.
